# Cozmap

## Project Description

_Cozmap_ is an educational experience that teaches kids about sequencing. Kids can draw paths on an interface on the PC and drop events onto the path ( like saying text, lift Cozmoâ€™s arms, tilt his head, etc., ). When they hit play, they can watch Cozmo following the instructions and drive along the path performing the actions that were put onto the path. Pygame was used to create the interface.

## Implementation Details

The demo uses a lot of the functions that the Cozmo SDK provides. Kids can draw a path on their computer using a pygame interface and place actions like "say_text","set_lift_height","set_head_angle", and "drive_straight". All of these actions are customizable and the user can edit the value of each event.

## Instructions

There are a few dependencies on other Python libraries: 
pygame is used to create a graphical user interface for a user to draw the path

## Thoughts for the Future
This short demo can be expanded to include a lot of actions and can be used by younger kids to start learning about sequencing and computational thinking. Currently, the program only supports straight lines on the path, it could be expanded to include curved lines to make it more freeform and fun for kids.
